The application consists of a GUI created in java swing in which the user is able to:
-add vehicles based on their registration plate as well as add details about the vehicles(ex: weight, length, colour, manufacturer etc.);
-search for specific vehicles by their registration plate;
-remove existing vehicles;
-visualize all added vehicles;
-sort added vehicles by their characteristics, ascending or descending;
-add filters so that only specific vehicles will be shown(ex: vehicles with weight less then 3.5 t);
The application can be further improved using databases.
